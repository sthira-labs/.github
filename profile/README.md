# Sthira Labs

**Sthira Labs** is a community-driven open-source organization dedicated to
building **stable, clean, and developer-first tooling** for the Laravel ecosystem.

Rooted in the philosophy of *Sthira* (स्थिर) — meaning *steadiness and reliability* —
our focus is on long-term maintainability, correctness, and calm engineering.

---

## Principles

- **Stability over hype**  
  Production-ready defaults that age well.

- **Simplicity over cleverness**  
  Clear APIs that are easy to reason about.

- **Standards & correctness**  
  Opinionated where it improves consistency.

- **Developer empathy**  
  Tools designed with real-world workflows in mind.

- **Community stewardship**  
  Open collaboration and shared ownership.

---

## Packages

- **laravel-deployments**  
  Migration-like deployment scripts for safe, repeatable releases.

> More packages coming soon under the Sthira Labs umbrella.
